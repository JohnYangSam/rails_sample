/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * The two below css comments are actually commands for the manifest file.
 *
 * The first includes the application.css file itself
 * The second includes all CSS files in the app/assets/stylesheets directory
 * including tree subdirectores.
 *
 * The RoR asset pipeline runs everything through pre-processors based on the file endings like .scss,
 * .js, .erb, etc. (and you can combine endings).
 *
 * The minified results of all processes sheets and scripts are placed in application.css and 
 * javascripts.js.
